A thoughtfully designed template for building modern Rails apps ðŸ”¥

Get started on your new app within minutes instead of hours ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

## Getting started

To get going clone this repository and perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repository
1. You can now run `bin/configure`, which will help you in configuring the template.
   Alternatively perform all of the following steps manually.
1. Change application name in `config/application.rb`.
1. Update `database.yml` to reflect the new application name.
1. Update `TODO` items in `config/environments/production.rb`.
1. If you plan on using Figaro, copy `config/application.yml.example` to `config/application.yml`.
1. ESLint is preconfigured for modern JS with React support (AirBnB styleguide). If you want to use
   it install packages with `npm install`, otherwise remove `.eslintrc` and `package.json`.
1. If you don't plan on tracking the template, you can remove the `.git` directory.
   Otherwise you can rename the remote:
   ```shell
   $ git remote rename origin rails_new
   ```
1. Add your new remote as appropriate.

## Note on Webpacker, the asset pipeline, and ES6

By default ES6 will not work for files in `app/assets/javascript` since Uglifier will fail to process them. This is why we applied the following change to `config/production.rb`, which allows you to use ES6 project wide:

```diff
-  config.assets.js_compressor = :uglifier
+  config.assets.js_compressor = Uglifier.new(harmony: true)
```

Also note that for everything to work properly on Heroku, you need to set up your buildpacks like this:

```
heroku buildpacks:clear
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
```

## Optional configurations

* If you want to use [AirBrake](https://airbrake.io), make sure the following 2 environment variables are set:
    * `AIRBRAKE_PROJECT_ID`
    * `AIRBRAKE_API_KEY`
* [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) is pre configured in `config/newrelic.yml`,
  but you need to comment in the environment variables for it work on Heroku
  (lines 10 and 17).

## Environment variables

| Variable              | Comment                                                                 |
