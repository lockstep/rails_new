## Getting started

To get going clone this repository and perform the following steps:

1. Run `rails credentials:edit` to re-generate `config/master.key` and create
   `config/credentials.yml.enc`.
1. If your application requires `ActiveStorage`, run `rails active_storage:install` to
   generate a migration that creates the necessary tables. Use `rails db:migrate` to
   run the migration.
1. You can now run `bin/configure`, which will help you in configuring the template.

As an alternative to running the script you can perform all of the following steps manually.

1. Change application name in `config/application.rb`.
1. Update `database.yml` to reflect the new application name.
1. Update `TODO` items in `config/environments/production.rb`.
1. If you plan on using Figaro, copy `config/application.yml.example` to `config/application.yml`.
2. ESLint is preconfigured for modern JS with React support (using [Prettier](https://prettier.io)).
   If you want to use it install packages with `npm install` / `yarn [install]`, otherwise remove
   `.eslintrc` and `package.json`.
3. If you don't plan on tracking the template, you can remove the remote, otherwise rename it and
   add your new remote as appropriate.:
   ```shell
   $ git remote rename origin rails_new
   $ git remote add origin ...
   ```

## Optional configuration options

* If you want to use [AirBrake](https://airbrake.io), make sure the following 2 environment
  variables are set:
    * `AIRBRAKE_PROJECT_ID`
    * `AIRBRAKE_API_KEY`
* [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) is pre configured in `config/newrelic.yml`, but you need to
  comment in the environment variables for it work on Heroku (lines 10 and 17).
* The app is preconfigured for Google Analytics, just add `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` to the environment.
* We prefer to use vanilla Sidekiq for worker/queue management. If you prefer
  to use ActiveJob please see the configuration/options that were removed in
  [59cf38d](https://github.com/lockstep/rails_new/commit/59cf38d5872eb8bd9267a5c0ae95aa39396c7130).

## Removed

The following default Rails gems have been removed:

* [jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder)

## Notes

### Webpacker, the asset pipeline, and ES6

By default ES6 will not work for files in `app/assets/javascript` since Uglifier will fail to
process them. This is why we applied the following change to `config/production.rb`, which allows
you to use ES6 project wide:

```diff
-  config.assets.js_compressor = :uglifier
+  config.assets.js_compressor = Uglifier.new(harmony: true)
```

Also note that for everything to work properly on Heroku, you need to set up your buildpacks like
this:

```
heroku buildpacks:clear
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
```

### Custom classes

* `ApplicationDecorator`: lightweight alternative to Draper or similar gems.
* `ApplicationForm`: Minimal form class based on `ActiveModel`.
* `ApplicationPresenter`: a subclass of `ApplicationDecorator` for presenters, includes tag helpers.

All custom classes are fully documented with [yard](https://yardoc.org) and come with generators.

Use `yard doc` to generate documentation and `yard server --reload` or `yard server --gems` to start
a local documentation server.

### Gemfile.dev / Gemfile.dev.lock

If you want to add specific gems for development that may not be interesting for other developers,
you can add a `Gemfile.dev` (ignored by our `.gitignore`). Gems listed there can be installed with
`bundle install --gemfile Gemfile.dev` and the resulting lock file is gitignored too.

Example `Gemfile.dev`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

eval_gemfile 'Gemfile'

gem 'awesome_print'
```

The `eval_gemfile` line will ensure that all gems from your regular `Gemfile` will be included too.
The `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` variable can be used to let Bundler now which gemfile to use:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.dev rails c
```

### `Rack::RejectTrace` middleware

There's a custom middleware (`Rack::RejectTrace`) for completely disabling the HTTP TRACE method as
required by certain security audits. It can be enabled via the `BLOCK_HTTP_TRACE` environment
variable.

### Favicons

Favicons were generated with [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), consider
using the same tool when replacing them for your project.

## Docker

For those wishing to use Docker for development the whole app has been dockerized and the setup is
fairly well-documented. Features:

* Images use [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) to keep their size small.
* `docker-compose.yml` sets up and starts Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq, Rails and the Webpack dev server.
* Uses a persistent bundle cache, so there's no need to rebuild the image to add gems.
* Persistent volumes for Postgres and Redis.
* No exposed ports except for Rails (mapped to port `3000` by default)

The following files relate to our Docker setup:

* `Dockerfile`: main setup for the `app` container
* `docker-compose.yml`: Ties Postgres, Redis and `app` together
* `docker-entrypoint.sh`: Custom entry point to facilitate bundle caching
* `Procfile.docker`: Used by the entrypoint script to bring up services
* `.dockerignore`: similar to `.gitignore`, specifies files we don't want copied into the container

### Usage examples:

Start the environment and build the images if necessary:

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
Building app
[Step 1/12 : FROM ruby:2-alpine
 ---> 8302cc790fbf
Step 2/12 : RUN apk update && apk add --update --no-cache   build-base   chromium   chromium-chromedriver   git   imagemagick   libxml2-dev   libxslt-dev   nodejs   tzdata   postgresql-dev
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 9d1d0b398c26
Step 3/12 : RUN bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 0a5ca06d7700
Step 4/12 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> c61498ba7e64
[...]
```

Start the environment without (re-)building images (add `-d` to daemonize):

```sh
$ docker-compose up
Starting rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Starting rails_new_redis_1    ... done
Starting rails_new_app_1      ... done
Attaching to rails_new_postgres_1, rails_new_redis_1, rails_new_app_1
[...]
```

Stop the environment but keep the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose stop
Stopping rails_new_app_1      ... done
Stopping rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Stopping rails_new_redis_1    ... done
```

Stop the environment and remove the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose down
Stopping rails_new_app_1      ... done
Stopping rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Stopping rails_new_redis_1    ... done
Removing rails_new_app_1      ... done
Removing rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Removing rails_new_redis_1    ... done
Removing network rails_new_default
```

Execute a command inside the `app` container:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec app ruby -v
ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-linux-musl]
```

Execute a command inside the `app` container that needs env variables:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec --env RAILS_ENV=test app rails db:setup
Created database 'rails_new_test'
-- enable_extension("plpgsql")
   -> 0.0251s
-- create_table("users", {:force=>:cascade})
   -> 0.0366s
```

Adding a new gem (does not require image rebuild):

```sh
# update Gemfile
$ docker-compose exec app bundle
```

Running specs:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec app rspec
