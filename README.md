## Getting started

To get going clone this repository and perform the following steps:

1. Run `rails credentials:edit` to re-generate `config/master.key` and create `config/credentials.yml.enc`.
1. If your application requires `ActiveStorage`, run `rails active_storage:install` to generate a migration that creates the necessary tables. Use `rails db:migrate` to run the migration.
1. You can now run `bin/configure`, which will help you in configuring the template.

As an alternative to running the script you can perform all of the following steps manually.

1. Change application name in `config/application.rb`.
1. Update `database.yml` to reflect the new application name.
1. Update `TODO` items in `config/environments/production.rb`.
1. If you plan on using Figaro, copy `config/application.yml.example` to `config/application.yml`.
1. ESLint is preconfigured for modern JS with React support (using [Prettier](https://prettier.io)). If you want to use it install packages with `npm install` / `yarn [install]`, otherwise remove `.eslintrc` and `package.json`.
1. If you don't plan on tracking the template, you can remove the remote, otherwise rename it and add your new remote as appropriate.:
   ```shell
   $ git remote rename origin rails_new
   $ git remote add origin ...
   ```

## Optional configuration options

- If you want to use [Sentry](https://sentry.io), you'll need to:
  1. Create two projects under your organization on Sentry. This way you can keep frontend and backend errors separate.
  1. Set `SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND` and `SENTRY_DSN_FRONTEND` environment variables. Both are optional - errors will only be reported if the respective variable is set.
- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) is pre configured in `config/newrelic.yml`, but you need to comment in the environment variables for it work on Heroku (lines 10 and 17).
- The app is preconfigured for Google Analytics, just add `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` to the environment.
- We prefer to use vanilla Sidekiq for worker/queue management. If you prefer to use ActiveJob please see the configuration/options that were removed in [59cf38d](https://github.com/lockstep/rails_new/commit/59cf38d5872eb8bd9267a5c0ae95aa39396c7130).

## Contents

All of the following have been installed and pre-configured:

### Base system

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL >= 9.2
- [pg](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg) for `ActiveRecord`
- NodeJS

NOTE: We recommend that you install and manage these system dependencies using
a combination of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Postgres),
[asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/#/) (Ruby, NodeJS) and
[Bundler](https://bundler.io/) (Ruby on Rails). If you are starting fresh on
a new system you may want to manage these package managers with a script
like the [thoughtbot laptop script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) with
the option to add your own opinionated extensions,
e.g. [this](https://github.com/hiattp/dotfiles). Your code base should be under
version control, why not your system toolkit and configuration as well?

## Removed

The following default Rails gems have been removed:

- [coffee-rails](https://github.com/rails/coffee-rails)
- [jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder)

## Notes

### `Account` vs `User`

Authentication concerns (your typical `Devise` configuration) are handled by the `Account` model. To connect this to one of several potential user roles the polymorphic `authenticatable` relationship is used.

### Heroku Buildpacks

Note that for everything to work properly on Heroku you need to set up your buildpacks like this:

```
heroku buildpacks:clear
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/metrics
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
```

### React

React support has been preconfigured together with `react-rails`.

When creating a new component you want to mount in the view, place it under the `views` folder. `react-rails` will perform module lookup relative to that folder and automatically require it under the hood so it gets included in the `application` pack. For example, calling the following helper in your view file:

```ruby
react_component("dashboard/properties_list")
```

will require `views/dashboard/properties_list` and mount it in place of the helper element. See the [docs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) for details about working with `react-rails`.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is supported out of the box.

It is important to note that TypeScript code is loaded by `babel-loader`. Because of that, you need to perform type checking in a separate process. This could either be your editor, or running `yarn types-watch` in your terminal to compile your code in watch mode.

This will not interfere with HMR (see below) as TypeScript compiler is instructed only to type-check your code, not to emit compiled modules.

For extra safety, there is a CI build step that runs `tsc` to make sure TypeScript code compiles

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

HMR is also supported out of the box. All you need to do is hot-export your module, like so:

```js
import React from "react";
import { hot } from "react-hot-loader/root";

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

export default hot(Welcome);
```

This will allow you to continue working on your JS code without losing application state in the browser.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Tests

The repo comes pre-configured with `jest`. You can write your tests in JavaScript or TypeScript.

We're following the convention of placing tests next to the file they're testing. They will be run as long as they have `test`, (e.g. `MyComponent.test.ts`) in the name.

You are encouraged to place your testing utility files under `app/javascript/test`.

To run your tests, run:

```
yarn test
```

### Polyfills

Polyfills are included automatically thanks to `@babel/preset-env`. See `babel.config.js` for configuration options.

### Custom classes

- `ApplicationDecorator`: lightweight alternative to Draper or similar gems.
- `ApplicationForm`: Minimal form class based on `ActiveModel`.
- `ApplicationPresenter`: a subclass of `ApplicationDecorator` for presenters, includes tag helpers.

All custom classes are fully documented with [yard](https://yardoc.org) and come with generators.

Use `yard doc` to generate documentation and `yard server --reload` or `yard server --gems` to start a local documentation server.

### `Gemfile.dev` / `Gemfile.dev.lock`

If you want to add specific gems for development that may not be interesting for other developers, you can add a `Gemfile.dev` (ignored by our `.gitignore`). Gems listed there can be installed with `bundle install --gemfile Gemfile.dev` and the resulting lock file is gitignored too.

Example `Gemfile.dev`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

eval_gemfile 'Gemfile'

gem 'awesome_print'
```

The `eval_gemfile` line will ensure that all gems from your regular `Gemfile` will be included too. The `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` variable can be used to let Bundler now which gemfile to use:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.dev rails c
```

### `Rack::RejectTrace` middleware

There's a custom middleware (`Rack::RejectTrace`) for completely disabling the HTTP TRACE method as required by certain security audits. It can be enabled via the `BLOCK_HTTP_TRACE` environment variable.

### Favicons

Favicons were generated with [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), consider using the same tool when replacing them for your project.

## Docker

For those wishing to use Docker for development the whole app has been dockerized and the setup is fairly well-documented. Features:

- Images use [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) to keep their size small.
- `docker-compose.yml` sets up and starts Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq, Rails and the Webpack dev server.
- Uses a persistent bundle cache, so there's no need to rebuild the image to add gems.
- Persistent volumes for Postgres and Redis.
- No exposed ports except for Rails (mapped to port `3000` by default)

The following files relate to our Docker setup:

- `Dockerfile`: main setup for the `app` container
- `docker-compose.yml`: Ties Postgres, Redis and `app` together
- `docker-entrypoint.sh`: Custom entry point to facilitate bundle caching
- `Procfile.docker`: Used by the entrypoint script to bring up services
- `.dockerignore`: similar to `.gitignore`, specifies files we don't want copied into the container

### Usage examples:

Start the environment and build the images if necessary:

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
Building app
[Step 1/12 : FROM ruby:2-alpine
 ---> 8302cc790fbf
Step 2/12 : RUN apk update && apk add --update --no-cache   build-base   chromium   chromium-chromedriver   git   imagemagick   libxml2-dev   libxslt-dev   nodejs   tzdata   postgresql-dev
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 9d1d0b398c26
Step 3/12 : RUN bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 0a5ca06d7700
Step 4/12 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> c61498ba7e64
[...]
```

Start the environment without (re-)building images (add `-d` to daemonize):

```sh
$ docker-compose up
Starting rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Starting rails_new_redis_1    ... done
Starting rails_new_app_1      ... done
Attaching to rails_new_postgres_1, rails_new_redis_1, rails_new_app_1
[...]
```

Stop the environment but keep the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose stop
Stopping rails_new_app_1      ... done
Stopping rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Stopping rails_new_redis_1    ... done
```

Stop the environment and remove the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose down
Stopping rails_new_app_1      ... done
Stopping rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Stopping rails_new_redis_1    ... done
Removing rails_new_app_1      ... done
Removing rails_new_postgres_1 ... done
Removing rails_new_redis_1    ... done
Removing network rails_new_default
```

Execute a command inside the `app` container:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec app ruby -v
ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-linux-musl]
```

Execute a command inside the `app` container that needs env variables:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec --env RAILS_ENV=test app rails db:setup
Created database 'rails_new_test'
-- enable_extension("plpgsql")
   -> 0.0251s
-- create_table("users", {:force=>:cascade})
   -> 0.0366s
```

Adding a new gem (does not require image rebuild):

```sh
# update Gemfile
$ docker-compose exec app bundle
```

Running specs:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec app rspec
